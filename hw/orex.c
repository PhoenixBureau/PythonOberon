This program drives an RGB LED in a simple pattern of random-seeming
colors.  It uses a timer interrupt to let the CPU stay mostly idle.

The timer is set to wake up the CPU ten times per second (10Hz) and each
LED in the RGB LED has its own blink period.  The periods are determined
by small prime numbers to give a long cycle time before the color pattern
repeats.

The periods, in tenths of a second, are 17, 23, and 39, so the total
cycle time is:

	17 * 39 * 23 = 15249

Or 1524.9 seconds.  Round up to 1525 and divide by 60 seconds in a minute
and you get a period of about 25.4 minutes.  Since the periods are odd
numbers the LEDs start the next cycle in the opposite state (on if they
were off, off if they were on) so the actual cycle time (before the
pattern repeats) is doubled, about 50.8 minutes.  Not bad, eh?


The factory default frequency of the ATmega328P is (close to) 1MHz. (It's
really 8MHz with a default divide-by-eight.)  If the timer prescaler is
set to divide the clock by 1024 we get a frequency of

	1000000Hz / 1024 = 976.5625Hz

This gives a clock tick duration of (unsurpisingly) 0.001024 seconds.  To
get a LED counter update tick of one tenth of a second we should count up

	0.1 / 0.001024 = 97.65625

Round up to 98 clock cycles per LED counter update tick.
