I am very excited about the latest Oberon version.  I'm writing a hardware
emulator for the new RISC processor using Python. So far the RISC processor is mostly working.
I've implemented a very crude "assembler" which is really little more
than a bunch of helper functions to emit binary instructions (in the form
of 32-bit-wide ints.
